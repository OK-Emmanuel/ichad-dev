# ICHAD Project

## Mission Statement

We are committed to helping adolescents and young adults build resilient mindsets, valuable skills, and strong support networks so they can navigate life's challenges without resorting to harmful substances. Since our inception, we have satisfied this need through the introduction of a wide array of programs.

## Our Why

Across communities, the rise in substance abuse among young people is alarming, often fueled by unemployment, lack of access to opportunities, and social pressures. At the ICHAD Project, we tackle these challenges head-on through education, skill development, mental health support, and community engagement programs.

## Vision

A world where every young person is empowered with the skills, support, and opportunities to lead a life free from drugs, full of purpose, and rich in possibilities.

## Mission

To prevent drug use by providing young people with sustainable alternatives that empower them mentally, socially, and economically.

## Our Commitments

1. Discourage the initiation/use and abuse of substances and introduce healthy alternatives.
2. Facilitate and encourage protective factors such as school, family, and community connectedness, facilitating life skills enhancement programs.
3. Equip young adults with relevant employable skills.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

- **SDG 3**: Strengthen the awareness and prevention of substance abuse for the promotion of Good Health and Wellbeing
- **SDG 4**: Promote Good Education that goes beyond the classroom and captures soft, hard, and digital skills
- **SDG 8**: Substantially reduce the rate of unemployed youth that lack basic vocational training through our healthy alternatives to drug approach, as well as our business funding initiative

## Our Values

- **Empowerment**: We don't just tell young people to "say no" to drugs, we equip them with reasons and resources to choose a better path.
- **Compassion**: Every young person's journey is different. We meet them where they are, offering judgment-free guidance and support.
- **Innovation**: We use modern, practical, and creative solutions to address real-world problems, from digital skills training to accessible therapy.
- **Community**: We believe prevention is a shared responsibility, and we foster networks of support to help young people thrive.
- **Integrity**: We are committed to transparency, accountability, and impact-driven action in everything we do.

## Our Philosophy

Our philosophy provides opportunities for young people to reach their full potential, imbibe the skills and confidence to make healthy choices that enable them to successfully navigate adolescence. While our focus is to keep young people drug and alcohol-free, we believe that the most effective way to do this is by addressing ROOT CAUSES which contribute to drug and alcohol use and abuse.
