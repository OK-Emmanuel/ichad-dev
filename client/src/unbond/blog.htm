By highlighting their stories, we hope to inspire others and provide these deserving individuals with the recognition and opportunities they need to continue thriving. \r\n\r\nOur commitment to fostering inclusivity and supporting the next generation is at the heart of our organisation. We understand that many young talents face barriers that prevent their accomplishments from being acknowledged. These awards are one of our ways of ensuring that their hard work, creativity, and determination do not go unrecognised. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is good to see a community come to together to celebrate these extraordinary young people and amplify their voices. Together, we can build a brighter future where every young person is valued and encouraged to reach their full potential”. \r\n\r\nRichard Pearce Kings Theatre CEO “It is wonderful to be working with fellow local charities and sharing Portsmouth’s beautiful Kings Theatre with such a young, diverse, talented and inspirational organisation within our community. We thank URBOND for trusting us with such an important evening and hope this paves the way for many more such events in the future. \r\n\r\nTo see so many outstanding young people being celebrated for their incredible achievements and contributions to their local community was truly humbling. And the support in the auditorium was exceptional”.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Julia Wisniewska Winner of Creativity Award** “Before I became involved with URBOND, I often found myself holding back in professional settings, unsure of my own voice. Growing up in England with English as my second language, I faced challenges that made public speaking a daunting task. Despite my ambition, I was often hesitant to assert myself, especially in environments where societal expectations urged me to stay quiet. \r\n\r\nAt URBOND, I’ve been able to contribute to our local area in meaningful ways—whether through engaging with bright young minds at the Youth Club or connecting with professionals from organisations like NIHR and Portsmouth City Council. \r\n\r\nThese experiences have transformed me. Today, I stand before you with a sense of confidence I never thought possible, especially in the realms of networking and public speaking. URBOND has truly paved the way for my personal and professional growth, providing opportunities that I will always be grateful for”. \r\n\r\n**Adobea Addo Winner of URBOND Award** “Having moved around a lot During my childhood, I didn’t have the chance to form deep connections or find a community where I truly felt at home. We finally settled in Portsmouth, where I discovered URBOND, one of the best experiences of my life. It has become my safe space, allowing me to forge new friendships and become part of a team as a youth ambassador, one of group of sixteen carefully chosen young people who represent the voices of our peers and strive to improve our community. At the start of our quarter, we set a goal to do at least 10 work experience placements, and I am proud to say we surpassed that target! And got a whopping 102 work experience placements. With URBOND I’m optimistic about making an even greater impact in the future, as there’s so much more we can achieve”.  \r\n\r\nURBOND’s Youth Development is working to drive opportunities, wellness and success for young people and their future and is addressing prevalent issues in the city such as youth crime, low literacy rates and unemployment. The programme is designed to support young people and provide them with the best opportunity to fulfil their potential.  \r\n\r\nThe charity’s mission, through hosting this event, was to recognise the achievements of young people from all different backgrounds in the city and create positive opportunities for those who experience systemic inequality and lack of support. \r\n\r\nURBOND believes that every young person has the potential to make a significant impact, regardless of their background, beliefs or circumstances. \r\n\r\n**Awards and Winners:** \r\n\r\n- **URBOND Award: Adobea Addo** \r\n\r\n- **Most Improved: Curtis Agha**  \r\n\r\n- **Role-Model Award: Jay Jay Young** \r\n\r\n- **Best Team Player Award: Leo Page-Curley** \r\n\r\n- **Helper Award: Jainaba Touray**  \r\n\r\n- **Community Award: Bethany Martin** \r\n\r\n- **Creativity Award: Julia Wisniewska** \r\n\r\n- **Visionary Award: Tasso Bakayoko Fofana**  \r\n\r\n- **Leadership Award: Caleb Anderson** \r\n\r\n- **Work Experience Award: Gabriel Osman** \r\n\r\n- **Motiv8: Binit Ghosh** \r\n\r\n- **Pompey in the Community: John Clucas**  \r\n\r\n- **Play Youth Community: Billy Crowhurst** \r\n\r\n- **Portsmouth Force: Malikai Sigauke**  \r\n\r\n- **Portsmouth City of Sanctuary: Maheep Kaur**  \r\n\r\n- **The Young Creatives: Poppy Bees-Croker**  \r\n\r\n- **Andrew Simpson Foundation: Stanley Matthews Bunting**  \r\n\r\n- **Music Fusion: Hugo Carey** \r\n\r\n![youth award]( /images/assets/yaward.jpg \"Award winners\")"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Youth Awards Ceremony","date":"2023-07-14","slug":"youth-award","image":"/images/assets/youth-awards.jpg","author":"URBOND","excerpt":"URBOND hosts first Youth Awards Ceremony in the City of Portsmouth."},"content":"\r\nOn Friday 14th July, URBOND hosted Portsmouth's first ever Youth Awards event to shine a light on the outstanding young people of our city.\r\n\r\nThe event was put together to celebrate and award young people that would otherwise get overlooked because of their background or status. \r\n\r\nWe awarded young people on a number of qualities and areas of progression we have seen over the past year.
